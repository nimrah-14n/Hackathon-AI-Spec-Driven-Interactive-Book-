# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records for the AI/Spec-Driven Interactive Book with Integrated RAG Chatbot project.

## Purpose

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the project, including the context, decision, consequences, and alternatives considered. This provides an audit trail for future reference and helps maintain architectural consistency.

## Format

Each ADR follows the template:
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated)
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: The chosen approach
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts
- **Implementation**: How the decision is implemented
- **Notes**: Additional relevant information

## Index of ADRs

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| 001 | Multi-Tier Architecture with Clear Separation of Concerns | Accepted |

## Guidelines

- Create an ADR for significant architectural decisions that affect multiple components
- Update the status when decisions change
- Reference ADRs in code comments and documentation when relevant
- Keep ADRs concise but comprehensive
- Ensure ADRs align with project constitution principles
