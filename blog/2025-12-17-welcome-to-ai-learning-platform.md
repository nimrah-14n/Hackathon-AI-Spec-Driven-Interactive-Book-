# Welcome to the AI Learning Platform

Welcome to our innovative AI Learning Platform, where we explore the fascinating intersection of Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Embodied Intelligence. This platform is designed to help students and researchers understand and work with cutting-edge AI systems that interact with the physical world.

## About Our Hackathon Project

This platform was developed as part of a hackathon focused on creating an interactive learning experience for complex AI and robotics concepts. Our goal is to make advanced topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics accessible to a broader audience.

## What You'll Learn Here

Through our comprehensive modules, you'll explore:

- **Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence**: Understanding how intelligence emerges from the interaction between agents and their environment
- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Learning the Robot Operating System that serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots
- **Digital-to-Physical AI**: Bridging the gap between digital AI systems and real-world applications
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Creating robots that can work alongside humans in natural environments

## Our Approach

We believe that embodied intelligence is the key to creating truly intelligent systems. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications, we aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience that prepares you for the future of AI and robotics.

Stay tuned for more content as we continue to develop this platform and add new modules covering advanced topics in AI and robotics.
